Amazon’s Prime Video service launched in 2014 and has quickly become a strategic priority for the organization, reflected in the service’s recent expansion into over 200 countries and territories around the world. Amazon invests on acquiring, producing and programming TV shows & movies – from brand new, including must-see exclusive series like The Grand Tour, Neil Gaiman’s American Gods, to The Man in the High Castle, Transparent, Mr Robot and more.Prime Video is known for its ground-breaking impact, and in case you think there is nothing more to do, then think again. We are building a new global innovation platform designed to transform how we develop, test, verify and automate against physical devices. With hundreds of devices currently supported, and many more being certified in the future, we are changing how we work with devices to ensure that even at this scale we can assure the exceptional customer experience at all times.Prime Video product teams are continually striving to deliver more features, and platform improvements, faster through CI/CD delivery platforms. With platform complexity increasing, and aggressive increases in the number of customer device types, our ability to test on customer devices has understandably struggled to keep up.Join us on a mission to change that!We are designing the next generation cloud platform for both physical and virtual devices.As we work from the physical tiers, onto micro-processors and right through to rack capacity we will be building custom solutions from the hardware systems to the contention management software. We aim to take away the complexity of device management, so that it can become a plug-and-play global network of self-managing, and self-healing, capacity.We work from the AWS cloud down, so we will be wrapping this all up securely using the latest AWS frameworks and tools into consumable RESTful APIs. Clients will be delivered as well as SDKs to enable customers to integrate and extend the capabilities.We are looking for builders, inventors and generally awesome engineers. We are looking for people with experience in hardware and systems integration, as well as pure software backgrounds, and we will be building specialized teams to make the best use of your skills.Complex and challenging – yes!Ambitious and audacious – yes!Innovative and impactful – yes!Is this you? Then please apply, join us, and make history…Working with devices is a hard engineering problem, due to the fact that they typically share no standard operating system, I/O, installation or debugging tooling. We have to support all of them from the latest Android right through to Smart TVs.Our mission is to solve this problem. We plan to make working with devices easy to the point that it becomes a transparent platform with homogeneous APIs no matter how complex the device itself might be.We are looking for outstanding inventors who can design, build and own both low level hardware systems and integration with networks and networked capabilities such as power over IP racks, VPN systems, and SMART TVs and games consoles.You will be working to create software driven capabilities to control devices using micro-processors, or flashing firmware using APIs, as well as working out how to rack mount and control TVs and boards in racks globally. Operational excellence is also your concern, and so you will be expected to define and implement metrics, and operational systems to monitor them, to ensure a reliable, performant, secure and frugal platform is provided to consumers.Ideally you will be a polyglot who cares about using the right language and tool for the job, as opposed to thinking only within the limits of your own experience. If you want to stretch yourself, as well as the boundaries of what is possible in modern tech then look no further.This really is an opportunity to make history and own your future. You do not need to know everything, you just need to want to, and bring along a bag of enthusiasm and positivity for the journey. Sign up. Make the impact you always wanted to.You will be an inventor working with a talented team of like-minded inventors. Collaboration and passion are essential ingredients for success and you will be surrounded by driven, forward thinking individuals.

       "  'Amazon Fulfillment Technologies (AFT) powers the physical engine at the heart of Amazon. AFT builds and operates software, hardware, and processes that run the global network of fulfillment centers that move many millions of units of inventory, employ tens of thousands of people, and ensure that customers get what they want when we promised we would get it to them. We do this by building automated solutions to handle things that technology does well, while relying on people to handle things that humans do well.Flow management is aimed at balancing the input and output of physical processes while minimizing the buffers between them. Balanced flow is achieved when the input from an upstream process is equal to the output of its downstream process. In the context of our fulfillment centers (FCs), everything that is picked has to be packed and everything that is received has to be stowed. When the rate at which the FC is picking is equal to the rate at which the FC is packing (or conversely receiving/stowing) we achieve balanced flow. Outbound Flow is a flow management solution that automates human decision points for our fulfillment center leads. It removes the need for these individuals to manage software controls and allows them to focus on managing people. All the sophistication and technical complexity is moved to software systems. Outbound Flow automates intra-day shift planning and labor allocation. The system uses capacity and charge (incoming customer orders) forecast information to determine the right allocation of labor across processes at the start of the shift. It also monitors buffers throughout the day and uses a cost-based system using mathematical models to decide if and when to move labor.The vision for Outbound Flow is that when associates clock-in at the start of shift, they are presented with a message that tells them which process area to report to. This is based on the optimal start of shift labor allocation computed by the system and accounts for their training. Over the course of the day, when the system detects a need to move labor, the corresponding associates are presented with a message on their scanner to move to the new process area. Similarly, when operations and area managers start their shifts, they are presented with the system-generated shift plan for the day and are able to monitor the production rates for their area. They are notified when there is a deviation from the plan that requires their intervention (e.g. insufficient labor/capacity, missed rate targets, etc.). The Outbound Flow system automatically manages software controls, performs load balancing across process paths, and moves labor when appropriate. We work backwards from the customer and eliminate all fulfillment related misses.As a member of a small team, you will get the opportunity to work on highly visible, innovative projects that directly impact the customer experience. You will be involved in all the aspects of the software development cycle including scoping, design, implementation, testing & delivery of your product. Our engineers are top-notch software developers who love listening to the customers, working as a team, and proactively taking the lead whenever necessary.”',\n",

       "  'Today, people spend too much of their day on tedious tasks at work, like managing their calendars, dialing in to meetings, or searching for information. But Amazon Alexa can help solve this problem by acting as an intelligent assistant at work. Alexa lets people use their voice to interact with technology so they can spontaneously ask questions in a way that feels natural. Alexa can help people take care of these tasks just by asking. Alexa can help people stay organized and focused on the things that matter, whether they are working in their office or at home. Alexa can simplify conference rooms, allowing meeting attendees to start meetings and control the equipment in the room by simply using their voice. Alexa can also do things around the workplace, like providing directions to a conference room, notifying IT about a broken printer, or placing an order for office supplies.The Alexa for Business team is building new capabilities into Alexa that help professionals be more productive at work. In addition to teaching Alexa new things, we provide tools that administrators need to manage Alexa at scale across a large organization. These new capabilities are unlocking a whole new set of use cases for Alexa, from the Office to Hotel Rooms, Restaurants and even sports stadiums. Come join us and help us use the power of voice computing to solve completely new challenges!As a highly skilled software development engineer on our team, you will be responsible for designing, building, and operating key pieces of customer facing functionality.
